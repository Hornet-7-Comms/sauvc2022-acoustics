Replace Components

    *: replace all instances of 160k replaced with 150k
      > 150k resistor is cheaper

    R#25: replace from 8k2 to 100k
      > reduce voltage divider because passband attenuation was not accounted for

    RX13: replace from 1k to 100R
      > convenience

    RX14: replace from 1k to 100R
      > convenience

    R#22: replace from 1k to 220R
      > lower impedance to ADC

Additions

    Flip IC2A to the top layer (pin compatible)
      > Save space on bottom standoff to be within height limitation

    Add 10uF (106) capacitor on JX1 to GND
      > Input signal noise is coupled as opamps draw current from Vbias supply
